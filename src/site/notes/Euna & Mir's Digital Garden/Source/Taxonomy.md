## üß¨Biological Classification System 
| Level | Term    | Detailed Description                                                                                                                                              | Example (Human)                                                                                           |

| 1     | Domain  | The broadest level of classification. Organisms are classified by basic cell type and genetic difference. There are three domains: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. | Eukarya - organisms with complex, membrane-bounded cells(like üêïanimals, üçÄplants, üçÑfungi and protists). |
| 2     | Kingdom | A major category under domain. Organisms are grouped by general characteristics such as how they get energy, cell structure, and reproduction.                    | Animalia - multicellular organisms that consume organic material, and can usually move.                   |
| 3     | Phylum  | Groups organisms with the same basic body structure or body plans, such as symmetry, presence of backbone, or segmented bodies.                                   | Chordata - animals that have, at some stage, a notochord(like a backbone).                                |
| 4     | Class   | It classify organisms based on more specific traits like reproduction way, internal anatomy and development.                                                      | Mammalia - animals that have hair/fur and produce üçºmilk to feed their young.                             |
| 5     | Order   | Group together families with similar characteristics or evolutionary traits. Often based on limb structures, diet, and behavior.                                  | Primates - animals with grasping hands, forward-facing eyes, and large brains(monkeys, apes, humans).     |
| 6     | Family  | Group related with genera (plural of genus) together. Members share more recent common ancestors and often resemble each other closely.                           | Hominidae - great apes, including humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans.                          |
| 7     | Genus   | A group of species that are very similar and closely related. The genus is the first part of a *scientific name*.                                                 | Homo - includes modern humans and closely related extinct species.                                        |
| 8     | Species | The most specific level. A species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. This is second part of a scientific name.           | Homo sapiens - modern humans.                                                                                                           |
